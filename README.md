# Pride Trails
# NOTE: I CANNOT add all pride flags as there is only 7 trails in the game currently.
# EDIT: There is a new mod called "Custom Patcher" which allows you to edit the amount of trails in the game, if you want to install it then scroll to the bottom of this file.
- Trails 2-7 are now different pride flags:
  - Trail 2: **Rainbow** Pride Flag
  - Trail 3: **Aroace** Pride Flag
  - Trail 4: **Pansexual** Pride Flag
  - Trail 5: **Transgender** Pride Flag
  - Trail 6: **Bisexual** Pride Flag
  - Trail 7: **Gay** Pride Flag
